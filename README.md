# Clogsten File Encrypter

Clogsten File Encrypter is an file encrypter which uses [aes-265-encryption (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard).

# Features
 - Encrpyt and save/replace files with password
 - Encrypt text to share with password
 - Change Background Image

##### NOTE: Password can't be reset once lost, your file is nearly irrecoverable, unless you try all combinations of digits till you crack the password.

[Electron JS "Framework"](https://www.electronjs.org/), which helps us use web tech to create desktop apps.

[Node js - File System(fs) "Module"](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#file-system), helps us to read and write to files.
